            <p className="text-[10px] md:text-[16px] font-medium">
              Founded in 2023, Pixeo was born out of a shared passion for
              design's transformative power. We envisioned a platform that not
              only provided the tools and resources for exceptional design but
              also connected people who shared a common love for the craft.
              Pixeo emerged from a simple yet profound idea: to create a space
              where creativity could flourish without limits. We are here to
              support, inspire, and connect, together, we are redefining the
              world of design.
